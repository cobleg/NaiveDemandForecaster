# NaiveDemandForecaster
A simple model that generates scenario based projections (aka forecasts) for grid-delivered electricity. Wrapped in a Shiny app. See this link to use the app: https://coble-neal.shinyapps.io/DemandForecaster/ 

## To do list:

- ~~Adjust the E_auto slider to better match the initial level of demand.~~
- ~~Add sliders for maximum penetration ratios of solar PVs and EVs as a proportion of total houses.~~
- ~~Add logistic function to drive solar PV and electric vehicle (EV) demand.~~
- ~~Make solar PV and EV demand a function of the grid-delivered electricity price.~~
- ~~Add commercial and industrial demand for electricity.~~
- Add ability to impose shocks on input variables after the initial time period.
- ~~Integrate with a translog cost function to drive the price of electricity, taking number of houses and average demand per house as inputs.~~
